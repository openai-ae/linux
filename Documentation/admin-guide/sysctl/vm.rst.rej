+anon_min_ratio
+==============
+
+This knob provides *hard* protection of anonymous pages. The anonymous pages
+on the current node won't be reclaimed under any conditions when their amount
+is below vm.anon_min_ratio.
+
+This knob may be used to prevent excessive swap thrashing when anonymous
+memory is low (for example, when memory is going to be overfilled by
+compressed data of zram module).
+
+Setting this value too high (close to 100) can result in inability to
+swap and can lead to early OOM under memory pressure.
+
+The unit of measurement is the percentage of the total memory of the node.
+
+The default value is 15.

+clean_low_ratio
+================
+
+This knob provides *best-effort* protection of clean file pages. The file pages
+on the current node won't be reclaimed under memory pressure when the amount of
+clean file pages is below vm.clean_low_ratio *unless* we threaten to OOM.
+
+Protection of clean file pages using this knob may be used when swapping is
+still possible to
+  - prevent disk I/O thrashing under memory pressure;
+  - improve performance in disk cache-bound tasks under memory pressure.
+
+Setting it to a high value may result in a early eviction of anonymous pages
+into the swap space by attempting to hold the protected amount of clean file
+pages in memory.
+
+The unit of measurement is the percentage of the total memory of the node.

+This knob provides *hard* protection of clean file pages. The file pages on the
+current node won't be reclaimed under memory pressure when the amount of clean
+file pages is below vm.clean_min_ratio.
+
+Hard protection of clean file pages using this knob may be used to
+  - prevent disk I/O thrashing under memory pressure even with no free swap space;
+  - improve performance in disk cache-bound tasks under memory pressure;
+  - avoid high latency and prevent livelock in near-OOM conditions.
+
+Setting it to a high value may result in a early out-of-memory condition due to
+the inability to reclaim the protected amount of clean file pages when other
+types of pages cannot be reclaimed.
